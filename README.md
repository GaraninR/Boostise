# Boostise

Boostise is a test project for development test automation scripts on C# and .NET

## Requirements

For raising up the project we need to have:

1. Microsoft SQL Server (2017 or higher)
2. Docker
3. Microsoft DOTNET6
4. Newman (for API testing)

Boostise is crossplatform solution and can be runned on Linux, MacOS and Windows

## How to deploy solution

### Database preparing

### Mocking

As a mock system we use Wiremock
For running Wiremock:
Go to BoostiseBack/wiremock and run start_wiremock.sh

### API Documentation

As a API Doc server we use Swagger
For running Swagger:
Go to BoostiseBack/swagger and run start_swagger.sh

## How to run solution

### Running Back API Server

Set MS SQL Server parameters in database_configuration.json
You can keep parameters in database_sqlite3_configuration.json as is
Set Wiremock parameters in external_services.json

Go to BoostiseBack and execute:
dotnet run -project ./BoostiseBack/BoostiseBack.csproj --urls http://0.0.0.0:5045
Or
You can run solution in VSCode via a Terminal task "Run Back"

### Running Front

Set a Back API Server address in BoostiseFront/wwwroot/appsettings.json

Go to BoostiseFront and execute:
dotnet run -project ./BoostiseFront/BoostiseFront.csproj --urls http://0.0.0.0:5044
Or
You can run solution in VSCode via a Terminal task "Run Front"

## Testing

Project has Smoke tests in MS Excel file Boostise_E2E_Smoke_TS.xlsx inside solution

### API testing Postman/Newman

API tests for Postman are contained in api_tests directory
Before running set environment parameters in "Dev Environment.postman_environment.json"
You can run a collection via Postman
Or
You can run it via Newman with hepls a script run_newman_test.sh in api_tests directory

### GUI testing Automa

Automa tests are contained in BoostiseE2ETests/AutomaScripts

### GUI testing Selenium

For runnting Selenium tests

Set up edgedriver on your system (or driver for any your favorite browser) in ".driver" directory
Modify UnitTest1.cs for your Front-server address (and your driver if you've changed)
Run GUI/Selenium tests via command:
dotnet test
